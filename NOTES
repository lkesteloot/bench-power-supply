To do:

* Make new code project.
* Copy 68 kHz code from other project.
* Copy code to change target to 1 V and 4 V at 10 Hz (no feedback).
- Build low-pass filter on pin to get output.
- Try it with a load.
    - Data pins have 40 mA max.
    - 4 V / 40 mA = 100 Ω.
    - 4 V * 40 mA = 0.16 W.
- Add source power of 12 V.
- Add voltage amplifier (NPN/PNP).
    - 1 KΩ and 2.2 KΩ = 3.2x
    - 5 V * 3.2 = 16 V
- Add feedback resistors.
    - 100 kΩ and 220 kΩ = 1/3.2x
- Add feedback loop for voltage control.
- Switch between 1 V and 11 V.
- Add current amplifier.
    - Need power NPNs.
        - Circuit has:
            - BD137 (1.5 A, 1.25 W)
            - BD435 (4 A, 36 W)
        - See Jameco cart.
- Try bigger load.

    - At 5 V, the transistor is dropping 12 V - 5 V = 12 V.
    - At 1 A, that's 5 W.
    - https://www.fairchildsemi.com/datasheets/BD/BD433.pdf
    - According to figure 6, that's about 135 °C max case temperature.
- Add current sense resistor.
- Add current limit code.
